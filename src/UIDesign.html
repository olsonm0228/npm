                <br>Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable, and appealing when displayed.  Although this is not a UI specific topic, it is good to be aware of when creating UIs.  Applying this subject to UI design helps to communicate with the user and improve the user experience.
                <br><br>Alignment is the action of placing elements.  3 common ways to align your text are left-aligned, centered, and right-aligned.  In general left-aligned text is for languages that read left to right like English and right-aligned is for languages that read right to left like Hebrew.  You can use centered text for shorter elements within a layout, like when you are using a quote.
                <br><br>Negative space or white space is the area between individual elements.  In typography it is the space between blocks of text.  Properly designing the negative space can make the text more readable and feel less cluttered on the page.
                <br><br>Leading is the spacing between lines of text.  Using appropriate leading helps readers go from one line of text to another.  The standard leading is 120% - 140% the point size of the font.  More space can be needed with smaller fonts.  You do not want to minimize the space between lines.  This makes the text look crowded and it becomes harder to read.
                <br><br>Hierarchy is structuring your content in a way that guides the users through the content.  Doing this helps users to parse through the information fast and can guide them to the most important information first and follow it to the relevant information.
                <br><br>When choosing a font for your text it is usually best to choose a system font.  They come pre-installed on your device, typically have wide language support, and there are no licensing costs for the developers to use it.  Using the same font throughout a site also makes the look more consistent.  However, something to consider is that using a system font will not stand out due to it being used in many places already.  You should also be careful when using multiple fonts at the same time.  If you do use more than one font you should make sure that the selected fonts work well together.  You should also stay away from using more than 3 different fonts.  This could make the site look busy and more confusing for the reader.
                <br><br>The color and contrast of the text is important to pay attention to.  Screens have more severe contrast than paper, so it is a good idea to use less contrasting colors like using dark gray instead of black for the text.  This makes it easier on the eyes of the reader.

                <br>Knowing how to design a good user interface is very important with web design.  A poorly designed user interface can leave a user confused and frustrated.  If an interface is done well, a user will not even notice they will just be able to use the product.  Most designers follow some common design practices.  Below are some general practices that can be used to guide software design.
                <br><br>You want to put the users in control of the interface.  The interface should be guiding them, not controlling their actions.  It should also be forgiving, allow for the users to make mistakes and have their actions be reversible.  For example, this could be filling out a form incorrectly or accidently deleting the wrong file.  For those situations you would want to let the user go back on their action and have it be clear how they would do that.
                <br><br>The interface should be easy to navigate.  It should be made clear what everything on the page does.  This can be accomplished by using standards that other pages use so it is familiar and intuitive for the user.  The interactive parts of the interface should also give feedback to the user, so they know it is interactable.  The feedback can be as simple as a button changing color or a progress bar changing.  This can also follow standards, so the user knows what to expect when they interact.
                <br><br>Consistency is important in the interface.  This includes both visually and functionally.  The visual theme of the interface should extend to all pages and elements of it.  This is the same for the functionality of all the elements.  This makes it less likely that the user will get confused when switching between pages and interacting with the page.
                <br><br>Interfaces should be scalable.  Users now use many different devices with different screen sizes.  This means that interface design should accommodate for all those different sizes and change based on what the user is using.  The elements of the page should also be accessible.  This means that it should be as accommodating as possible to anyone with a disability trying to use your page.  This can include putting alt tags on images, designing the colors for the color blind, and having a text alternative for a video.
